My interest in computers goes back to when I was growing up. My father, an IT professional, was handy with computers and was constantly trying to teach me different things about how they work. While I picked up little things here and there, and was able to navigate windows platform with ease, I never fully dived in to Computer Science and Software Development. But, I never fully lost interest.

I considered majoring in Computer Science in college too late, after I was deep in a Biology degree that would eventually (and weirdly) enough lead me in to Healthcare Advertising in New York City.

After a few years working at various Adveritsing Agencies, I eventually ended up with the company WebMD. It's at this job where I have been exposed to working with Web Development and Coding experts, as a project manager and Account Manager. This experience has sparked my interest in a career in software development and coding even more. The way that small bits of code can come together create well designed and highly functional Websites, Computer Software, Apps, and more is truly amazing. Technology shapes the way that we interact with the world, and I would love to be a part of a growing and rapidly evolving industry.

I signed up for Flatiron School in November 2017. I've been off and off with this program since then. This type of learning has been somewhat foreign to me. Not that I don't have to problem solve in my daily work at WebMD, or I didn't have to problem solve as a Biology major in college, but coding truly teaches you to think "outside the box" and problem solve in a way that I've never done before. I'm ready and motivated to dive back in to this program and take advantage of all that Flatiron has to offer. Here goes nothing!
